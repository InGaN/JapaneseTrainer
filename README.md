How to use trainers:
- get a pen and paper.
- open the trainer of your choice.
- use the config to change timer settings and priority sorting.
- hide the parts of the word you wish to learn under Kanji > View ...
- use Spacebar to pause the timer.
- use the N key to skip.
- write down the part you wish to memorize and check your answer.
- give the word more or less priority the next time you start the trainer.

This is not a finished project. If you wish to use it you will need to compile it yourself.
